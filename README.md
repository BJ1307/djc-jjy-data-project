Dose-Response Relationship:
Question: How do different concentrations of the two treatments affect cytokine production levels in the MLR assay?
Objective: To quantify the dose-response relationship and determine if there's a threshold or saturation point where increasing the dose no longer significantly increases cytokine levels.

Comparative Effectiveness:
Question: How do the two different treatments compare in terms of their effectiveness at different concentrations for each cytokine?
Objective: To identify which treatment is more effective at modulating cytokine response at different dose levels and if one treatment consistently outperforms the other.

Interaction Effects:
Question: Are there interaction effects between different doses of the treatments on cytokine production? Does the combination of treatments have a synergistic or antagonistic effect?
Objective: To explore if the effect of one treatment varies depending on the presence or dose level of the other treatment, providing insight into possible synergistic effects.

Predictive Modeling:
Question: Can machine learning models accurately predict cytokine levels based on the dose of treatments applied? Which models perform best in predicting these outcomes?
Objective: To develop and validate predictive models using different machine learning techniques (e.g., random forest, gradient boosting) and evaluate their performance in predicting cytokine response.

Biomarker Identification:
Question: Which cytokines serve as the best biomarkers for indicating the immune response in MLR to different doses of treatments?
Objective: To identify key cytokines that correlate strongly with treatment doses and could potentially be used as biomarkers in monitoring immune response.
